Hi, I’m @ccyadu, working as a research assistant/ associate product manager in NTUST.
I’m interested in disaster management, combining STS(science, technology and society) and meteorology. 
Currently I'm learning WebGIS and some front-end skills to finish a simple project which display the map of abandoned strongholds around Matsu islands.
You could reach me simply by ccyadu@gmail.com
