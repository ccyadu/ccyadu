Hi, I’m @ccyadu, working as a research assistant/ associate product manager in NTUST. <br>
I’m interested in **disaster management**, which I could put my pervious academic trainings both STS(science, technology and society) and meteorology into practice. <br>
Currently I'm learning WebGIS and some front-end skills to finish a simple project which display the map of abandoned strongholds around Matsu islands.<br>
I'm a newbie here in github and IT field. It would be kind to give me some advices. 
You could reach me simply by ccyadu@gmail.com <br>
